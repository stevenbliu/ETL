 ETL Pipeline for Financial Transactions with Data Lake Integration
Problem: Integrating transactional data from multiple sources into a data lake for analytics and reporting, focusing on maintaining high data integrity.

Tools:

Apache Spark (for batch ETL processing)
Delta Lake / Apache Hudi (for ACID-compliant storage on data lake)
AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage (for data lake storage)
Airflow (for orchestrating ETL workflows)
Techniques:

Batch Processing: Use Spark for efficient batch processing to handle large volumes of financial transaction data, processing it in parallel across distributed clusters.
Data Partitioning: Partition the data by time (e.g., daily, monthly) to enable fast querying and improve performance in large datasets.
Schema Evolution: Implement Delta Lake or Hudi to allow schema evolution as financial data formats change over time without disrupting the pipeline.
Change Data Capture (CDC): Use CDC to capture and process only incremental changes to the data, ensuring that the pipeline remains efficient and does not reprocess the entire dataset.
Why these tools and techniques?

Spark is optimized for large-scale batch processing and is highly scalable, making it perfect for processing financial transaction data.
Delta Lake provides ACID transactions on top of your data lake, ensuring data integrity even as the schema evolves.
CDC minimizes data processing time and system overhead by focusing on incremental changes instead of full reprocessing.
