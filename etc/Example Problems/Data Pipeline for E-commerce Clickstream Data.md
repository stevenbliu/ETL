Problem: Real-time processing of user clicks on an e-commerce website to provide up-to-date analytics and personalized recommendations.

Tools:

Apache Kafka (for real-time event streaming)
Apache Spark Streaming (for stream processing)
AWS S3 (for storage)
Apache Hudi / Delta Lake (for handling real-time data ingestion with ACID compliance)
Techniques:

Stream Processing: Use Kafka for real-time ingestion of clickstream data and Spark Streaming for processing it in real time. This will ensure that user interactions are reflected immediately in your analytics.
Windowing: Implement time-based windowing in Spark Streaming to aggregate user interactions over defined periods, enabling efficient processing of session-based data.
Fault Tolerance: Implement Spark’s checkpointing mechanism and Kafka’s message replication to handle failure scenarios gracefully.
Backpressure Handling: Utilize Kafka’s backpressure mechanisms and ensure that Spark Streaming scales dynamically to avoid overwhelming the system during high traffic periods.
Why these tools and techniques?

Kafka provides low-latency event streaming, making it ideal for real-time clickstream data.
Spark Streaming is highly scalable and can handle large-scale stream processing, making it efficient for aggregating and analyzing data in real-time.
Time-based windowing helps group data effectively, making it manageable for analytics.
Fault tolerance ensures high availability, preventing downtime and ensuring that data isn’t lost during peak times.
