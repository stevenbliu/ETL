Multi-Region Data Replication and Disaster Recovery
Problem: Implement a system for replicating data across regions for high availability and disaster recovery.

Tools:

AWS S3 (for object storage)
AWS DynamoDB (for NoSQL data replication)
AWS RDS (for relational database replication)
Techniques:

Multi-Region Replication: Use DynamoDB Global Tables or RDS cross-region replication to keep data available across multiple regions.
Automated Failover: Configure RDS or DynamoDB for automated failover in case of region failure, ensuring minimal downtime.
Data Backup and Recovery: Implement automated backups with S3 and RDS snapshots to ensure data can be restored in case of disaster.
Data Consistency: Use eventual consistency for non-critical data and strong consistency for transactional systems to balance performance and integrity.
Why these tools and techniques?

AWS provides robust replication and failover mechanisms, ensuring that data remains available even during regional outages.
Automated failover minimizes manual intervention and guarantees high availability.
Data backups and consistency models protect data integrity and ensure that the system can recover quickly from disasters.
