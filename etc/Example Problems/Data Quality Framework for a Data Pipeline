Data Quality Framework for a Data Pipeline
Problem: Ensure the quality of data flowing through an ETL pipeline for accurate business intelligence and decision-making.

Tools:

Great Expectations (for data validation)
Apache Airflow (for pipeline orchestration)
Apache Spark (for data processing)
Techniques:

Data Validation: Use Great Expectations to enforce quality checks at various stages of the pipeline, ensuring that the data meets predefined standards.
Automated Testing: Implement unit tests and integration tests within the pipeline to validate each transformation step and prevent data corruption.
Data Profiling: Use profiling tools to understand data distribution, ensuring that anomalies are detected early.
Error Handling: Implement retry mechanisms and dead-letter queues to ensure that the pipeline can recover gracefully from failures.
Why these tools and techniques?

Great Expectations enables you to define and automate data quality checks, reducing manual effort and ensuring that the data is always reliable.
Testing and profiling techniques help maintain high data integrity, ensuring that the pipeline remains error-free over time.
Error handling ensures resilience, allowing the system to recover from issues without impacting downstream applications.
