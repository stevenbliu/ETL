Distributed Data Warehouse for Marketing Analytics
Problem: Design and implement a scalable, high-performance data warehouse for storing and analyzing marketing campaign data.

Tools:

Google BigQuery or Snowflake (for the distributed data warehouse)
dbt (for data transformation)
Looker or Tableau (for data visualization)
Techniques:

Columnar Storage: Use BigQuery or Snowflake, which leverage columnar storage for faster query processing, especially important for analytical workloads.
Data Sharding: Implement sharding to distribute data across multiple nodes to ensure that queries remain performant as the system scales.
Materialized Views: Use materialized views to store precomputed aggregates, significantly reducing the query time for frequently used aggregations.
Query Optimization: Apply partition pruning, indexing, and clustering to optimize performance on large datasets.
Why these tools and techniques?

BigQuery and Snowflake are optimized for analytics and are built to handle petabytes of data, which ensures scalability as marketing data grows.
Materialized views and query optimizations make it easier to run quick analytics without reprocessing the entire dataset.
Sharding and columnar storage are fundamental for achieving fast, scalable analytics, especially for large marketing datasets.
