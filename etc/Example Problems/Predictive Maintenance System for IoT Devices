Predictive Maintenance System for IoT Devices
Problem: Create a system to predict IoT device failures based on real-time sensor data, enabling proactive maintenance.

Tools:

Apache Kafka (for real-time data streaming)
Apache Flink (for real-time stream processing)
TensorFlow / Scikit-learn (for predictive modeling)
AWS Lambda (for serverless computation)
Techniques:

Stream Processing: Use Kafka to stream sensor data and Flink to process it in real time, ensuring that sensor data is processed immediately.
Anomaly Detection: Implement anomaly detection algorithms (such as Isolation Forests or LSTM-based models) to flag unusual sensor readings that could indicate device failures.
Time-series Forecasting: Apply time-series forecasting models like ARIMA or LSTM to predict future device performance and potential failures.
Stateful Stream Processing: Use Flinkâ€™s stateful processing to maintain the context of IoT devices, ensuring accurate anomaly detection over time.
Auto-scaling with Serverless: Use AWS Lambda to trigger model predictions dynamically, scaling the computation based on incoming data.
Why these tools and techniques?

Kafka and Flink enable real-time data ingestion and processing, which is critical for immediate failure detection.
Anomaly detection and time-series forecasting techniques help predict and prevent device failures, reducing maintenance costs.
Serverless scaling with Lambda ensures that the system can scale automatically without the need for manual infrastructure management.
