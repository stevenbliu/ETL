5. Serverless Data Processing with Event-Driven Architecture
Problem: Design an event-driven serverless architecture to process data from various sources and trigger business workflows.

Tools:

AWS Lambda (for serverless functions)
AWS EventBridge / AWS SNS (for event-driven architecture)
DynamoDB (for fast, scalable NoSQL storage)
AWS Step Functions (for orchestrating workflows)
Techniques:

Event-Driven Architecture: Use EventBridge or SNS to trigger Lambda functions when specific events occur, ensuring that processing happens in response to data changes without polling.
Serverless Design: Leverage AWS Lambda to run code in response to events, scaling automatically with demand and reducing infrastructure management overhead.
Microservices: Break down tasks into smaller, isolated functions that can be independently maintained and scaled.
Auto-scaling: Use Lambda and DynamoDB to scale both computation and storage dynamically, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
Why these tools and techniques?

Event-driven architecture minimizes delays and reduces costs by triggering computation only when necessary.
Serverless design allows the system to automatically adjust to demand, optimizing cost and scalability without manual intervention.
Microservices and auto-scaling make the system flexible, maintainable, and cost-effective as it grows.
