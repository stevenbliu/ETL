## **Objectives**
1. Build a robust data pipeline capable of handling both **batch and real-time data**.
2. Ensure scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance for massive datasets.
3. Incorporate monitoring, automated testing, and CI/CD for **DataOps workflows**.
4. Demonstrate **leadership and architectural design** through documentation and optimizations.

## **Project Structure**
### **1. Orchestration and Workflow Automation**
#### **TODO**
- [x] Set up Airflow with `docker-compose` for orchestration.
- [x] Ran example DAGs via Airflow UI.
- [ ] Integrate weather API ingestion directly into an Airflow DAG.
- [ ] Implement **dynamic task generation** for DAGs based on varying inputs (e.g., dates, data availability).
- [ ] Create **conditional workflows** to handle failures or missing data.
- [ ] Optimize DAGs for **performance** (e.g., parallel tasks, task retries).
- [ ] Add **task-level monitoring** using Prometheus.

### **2. Data Ingestion**
#### **TODO**
- [x] Extracted weather data via a RESTful API.
- [x] Set up Kafka using `docker-compose` and tested Producer/Consumer scripts.
- [ ] Develop a **real-time pipeline** using Kafka Streams for transaction data enrichment.
- [ ] Ingest data from multiple formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) and multiple sources (e.g., APIs, file storage).
- [ ] Stream data from Kafka into a distributed batch-processing framework (e.g., Apache Spark).
- [ ] Automate ingestion to Redshift/Snowflake for analytics-ready storage.

---

### **3. Data Transformation**
#### **TODO**
- [ ] Perform **complex transformations**, including joins, aggregations, and window functions.
- [ ] Engineer features for downstream ML models.
- [ ] Build pipelines to enrich customer data with geolocation, transactional data, and churn probability.
- [ ] Validate transformation logic with **unit tests** (e.g., using Pytest).

---

### **4. Real-Time Processing**
#### **TODO**
- [ ] Build a **real-time fraud detection pipeline** using Kafka Streams or Apache Flink.
- [ ] Implement **stateful streaming operations** (e.g., sessionization, sliding windows).
- [ ] Integrate with a dashboard to visualize real-time metrics.

---

### **5. Scalability**
#### **TODO**
- [ ] Configure Apache Spark for distributed batch processing of massive datasets.
- [ ] Benchmark the pipeline for throughput and latency under increasing workloads.
- [ ] Optimize storage and querying using Snowflake features (e.g., clustering, materialized views).

---

### **6. Monitoring and Error Handling**
#### **TODO**
- [ ] Set up Prometheus and Grafana to monitor pipeline performance (e.g., latency, throughput).
- [ ] Configure **alerting rules** for failures and resource bottlenecks.
- [ ] Implement **error handling and retries** for failed pipeline steps.
- [ ] Monitor data quality using **Great Expectations**.

---

### **7. Automation and CI/CD**
#### **TODO**
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions to automate DAG deployment to Airflow.
- [ ] Create Docker images for all services (Airflow, Kafka, Spark).
- [ ] Automate data quality checks and unit tests in the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Document the pipeline for reproducibility and handoffs.

---

### **Advanced Enhancements**
#### **TODO**
- [ ] Add **machine learning pipelines** for prediction (e.g., customer segmentation, demand forecasting).
- [ ] Integrate with cloud-based services (e.g., AWS S3, GCP BigQuery, Azure Data Lake).
- [ ] Incorporate **role-based access control (RBAC)** for data governance.

## **How to Run**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the setup guides in each directory (`airflow/`, `kafka/`, etc.) to start individual services using Docker Compose.
3. Execute DAGs or streaming pipelines as described in the documentation.

## **Learning Goals**
This project aims to:
- Build expertise in designing scalable, reliable ETL pipelines.
- Learn to integrate diverse tools for batch and real-time processing.
- Master orchestration, monitoring, and automation tools for modern data engineering.
