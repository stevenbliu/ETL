## Orchestration and Automation
- [x] Set up Airflow with Docker Compose.
- [ ] Add the weather API fetcher to Airflow DAGs for execution.
- [ ] Configure scheduling and triggers (e.g., CRON expressions or event-based triggers).
- [ ] Implement retries and failure handling for DAG tasks.
- [ ] Use Airflow Variables and Connections for dynamic and secure configurations.
- [ ] Manage task dependencies with upstream/downstream relationships.

## Data Sources
### API Ingestion
- [x] Extract weather data via API.
- [ ] Automate periodic API calls and handle pagination or rate-limiting.
- [ ] Normalize and clean API response data for downstream processing.

### Streaming Data (Kafka/Flink)
- [x] Set up Kafka with Docker Compose.
- [x] Test Producer/Consumer for synthetic transaction data.
- [ ] Implement Kafka Streams or Apache Flink for real-time data transformations.
- [ ] Integrate schema validation (e.g., Avro, Protobuf).
- [ ] Build a real-time dashboard using streaming data.

### Batch Data (Redshift/PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Load batch data (e.g., historical weather or transaction data) into Redshift or PostgreSQL.
- [ ] Optimize queries in Redshift/PostgreSQL (e.g., indexing, partitioning).

### File-Based Data
- [ ] Parse, combine, and validate data from CSV/JSON files.
- [ ] Handle edge cases like missing or malformed rows.

---

## Data Transformation
- [ ] Perform joins (e.g., enrich weather data with geolocation or customer metadata).
- [ ] Apply aggregations (e.g., calculate daily/weekly averages).
- [ ] Use window functions for time-based analysis (e.g., rolling averages, moving sums).
- [ ] Engineer features (e.g., geolocation clustering, churn probability scoring).

---

## Scalability
- [ ] Process large datasets using Apache Spark with distributed computations.
- [ ] Implement Flink for scalable real-time stream processing.
- [ ] Benchmark performance under increased loads (e.g., execution time, memory usage).
- [ ] Ensure scalability through horizontal scaling and resource optimization.

---

## Real-Time Processing
- [ ] Design a real-time fraud detection pipeline using Kafka Streams or Flink.
- [ ] Integrate machine learning models into real-time pipelines.
- [ ] Implement sliding/tumbling windows for event aggregation.
- [ ] Visualize real-time metrics on a dashboard.

---

## Error Handling and Monitoring
- [ ] Configure Prometheus to monitor pipeline health and performance.
- [ ] Visualize metrics (e.g., task success rates, latencies) using Grafana.
- [ ] Implement alerting for pipeline failures or performance bottlenecks.
- [ ] Include retry mechanisms and dead-letter queues for handling failed data.

---

## Data Storage
- [ ] Store processed data in PostgreSQL for structured analysis.
- [ ] Set up a Snowflake warehouse for scalable storage solutions.
- [ ] Optimize storage costs with partitioning and data compression.
- [ ] Automate periodic cleanup or archiving of historical data.

---

## Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Write unit tests for ETL functions (e.g., data transformations, API handlers).
- [ ] Implement integration tests to validate the entire ETL pipeline.
- [ ] Document pipeline setup, configurations, and usage (README or Wiki).
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for automated deployments and testing.

---

## Advanced Enhancements
- [ ] Use Terraform or Helm for infrastructure as code (IAC) to provision resources.
- [ ] Containerize services with Docker and orchestrate with Kubernetes.
- [ ] Explore DataOps principles for continuous delivery and monitoring of pipeline updates.
- [ ] Integrate ML models and pipelines (e.g., model serving with MLFlow or TensorFlow Serving).
- [ ] Add data lineage tracking (e.g., using OpenLineage or Marquez).
