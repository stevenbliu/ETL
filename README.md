# Data Engineering Project 

This checklist represents a comprehensive approach to building a senior-level data engineering project, with tasks divided into specific, manageable phases. 
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: It includes foundational tasks, real-time processing, scaling, error handling, and automation.
- **Progressive Complexity**: Tasks are ordered from simple setup to advanced integrations, ensuring a logical flow.
- **Real-World Focus**: The project mimics what senior-level data engineers work on in production systems (orchestration, streaming, scalability).

## Phase 1: Setup and Foundational Components

### 1. Orchestration with Apache Airflow
- [x] Set up **Apache Airflow** with `docker-compose` and verify the environment is running.
- [x] Run example **DAGs** to ensure the environment is working correctly.
- [ ] Integrate a basic **DAG** to fetch weather data from an external **API**.
- [ ] Include **Airflow's scheduling system** to automate API fetches for weather data.
- [x] Added basic DAG scheduled for every 1 min with cron expressions. (Shorter time requires more work)
- [x] Set up logging of DAGS. Viewable in UI.
- [ ] Set up DAGs on Trigger.

### 2. Data Ingestion Basics
- [x] **Ingest weather data** from an external **API** 
- [x] Set up **Kafka** using `docker-compose` to manage data streams.
- [x] Create and test **Kafka Producer** to send synthetic data.
- [x] Create and test **Kafka Consumer** to receive synthetic data.

### 3. Data Storage
- [ ] Set up a **PostgreSQL** or **Snowflake** database to store ingested data.
- [ ] Write a pipeline to ingest weather data into **PostgreSQL/Snowflake** and ensure successful data storage.
- [ ] Ensure database schema and tables are optimized for time-series or batch data (weather data, in this case).

## Phase 2: Batch and Real-Time Data Integration

### 4. Batch Processing with Apache Spark
- [ ] Install **Apache Spark** on your local environment or cloud.
- [ ] Write a **Spark batch job** to process the weather data stored in PostgreSQL/Snowflake.
- [ ] Perform aggregations, joins, and other batch transformations on the data.
- [ ] Store the processed data back into the database for downstream analysis.

### 5. Real-Time Processing with Kafka Streams
- [ ] Set up **Kafka Streams** for processing real-time data (transaction data, etc.).
- [ ] Build a **Kafka Streams topology** for real-time processing of incoming data.
- [ ] Integrate **stream-to-batch data pipeline** to feed Kafka data into the PostgreSQL/Snowflake database.
- [ ] Handle time-based operations (e.g., windowing) in your Kafka Streams pipeline.

## Phase 3: Data Transformation and Advanced Processing

### 6. Data Transformation
- [ ] Perform **data transformations** using batch processing tools (Spark).
  - Example: Join weather data with external datasets like geolocation information.
  - Example: Create features such as churn probability or customer profiling.
- [ ] Write **complex SQL queries** involving joins, window functions, and aggregations for real-time and batch data.
- [ ] Ensure **data quality** through transformations, handling null values, and ensuring data consistency.

### 7. Real-Time Fraud Detection Pipeline
- [ ] Set up **Flink** or **Kafka Streams** for fraud detection with real-time transaction data.
- [ ] Implement **stateful stream processing** in Kafka Streams or Flink (e.g., sessionization).
- [ ] Integrate **machine learning models** for real-time prediction (e.g., detecting fraudulent transactions).
- [ ] Implement a **real-time alerting system** when fraud is detected.

---

## Phase 4: Monitoring, Scalability, and Error Handling

### 8. Monitoring and Alerting
- [ ] Set up **Prometheus** to monitor the health and performance of your data pipeline.
- [ ] Integrate **Grafana** with Prometheus for visualizing pipeline metrics (e.g., processing time, throughput).
- [ ] Set up **alerting** for failed tasks, delays, and performance degradation in the pipeline.
- [ ] Monitor **Kafka consumer lag** and **Spark job performance**.

### 9. Error Handling
- [ ] Implement **error handling** in your DAGs to catch task failures.
- [ ] Implement **automatic retries** for failed tasks in both Airflow and Kafka.
- [ ] Set up **alerting** for failed pipeline steps, especially in real-time data processing.

### 10. Scaling the System
- [ ] Benchmark **Spark** performance on large datasets (e.g., scaling to 1TB of weather data).
- [ ] Optimize **Kafka producer and consumer** performance by adjusting partitioning and replication factors.
- [ ] Test **horizontal scaling** for Apache Spark jobs to distribute workload.
- [ ] Load test the system and identify bottlenecks.

---

## Phase 5: Automation and CI/CD

### 11. Automation
- [ ] Automate the **deployment** of the entire pipeline using **GitHub Actions** or another CI/CD tool.
- [ ] Write **Dockerfiles** for each component (Airflow, Kafka, Spark, Flink) and containerize them.
- [ ] Set up **automated tests** for each component of the data pipeline (using PyTest, Unittest, etc.).

### 12. Data Quality
- [ ] Integrate **Great Expectations** or another data quality tool to validate data at each pipeline stage.
- [ ] Write data validation checks for all datasets (schema validation, completeness, correctness).
- [ ] Automate **data quality tests** in the CI/CD pipeline.

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Enhancements

### 13. Machine Learning Integration
- [ ] Create a **feature engineering pipeline** to prepare data for machine learning models.
- [ ] Train and deploy **ML models** for prediction tasks such as churn or fraud detection.
- [ ] Integrate ML models into the streaming pipeline for real-time inference.
- [ ] Write batch jobs to retrain models periodically with new data.

### 14. Cloud Integration
- [ ] Migrate parts of your pipeline to **cloud services** like AWS, GCP, or Azure (e.g., S3 for storage, BigQuery for processing).
- [ ] Set up **cloud storage** for large-scale datasets and model outputs.
- [ ] Integrate **cloud data lakes** for scalable storage and processing.

### 15. Documentation
- [ ] Document the **architecture** of your pipeline (diagramming tools like Lucidchart or draw.io).
- [ ] Create detailed **README files** for each project component (Airflow DAGs, Kafka topics, Spark jobs, etc.).
- [ ] Write **technical documentation** for the pipeline, including setup instructions and dependencies.

## Phase 7: Final Testing and Deployment

### 16. Integration Testing
- [ ] Perform **end-to-end testing** of the entire pipeline to ensure all components work together.
- [ ] Validate data flow from ingestion to processing, transformation, and storage.
- [ ] Test **edge cases** (e.g., missing data, API failures, etc.).

### 17. Performance Tuning
- [ ] Fine-tune **Kafka settings** for higher throughput and lower latency.
- [ ] Optimize **Spark jobs** for faster processing with large datasets.
- [ ] Perform **load testing** to evaluate the system's performance under heavy usage.

### 18. Final Deployment
- [ ] Deploy the project to **production** (on-premises or cloud).
- [ ] Ensure that all components are configured for **production use**, including scalability, monitoring, and alerting.
- [ ] Set up a **maintenance plan** for periodic updates and model retraining.

## Additional Enhancements

### 19. Real-time Dashboard
- [ ] Build a **real-time dashboard** using tools like **Tableau** or **PowerBI** to visualize incoming data and ML model predictions.
- [ ] Ensure that the dashboard pulls data from the real-time Kafka streams or batch jobs.
